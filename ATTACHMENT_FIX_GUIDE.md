# Uploaded Attachment Not Visible - Fix Guide

## Problem Diagnosis
Your uploaded attachment is not visible because it's either:
1. Not placed in the correct directory (`public/`)
2. Not properly referenced in your React components
3. Using an incorrect file path

## Solutions

### 1. **Place Attachment in Public Directory**
```bash
# Move your uploaded file to the public directory
# Replace 'your-uploaded-file.jpg' with your actual filename
mv your-uploaded-file.jpg public/
```

### 2. **Update Image References in Code**

#### For Profile Image (About Section):
**Current code** (`src/components/sections/About.tsx` line 49):
```tsx
src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/771742/pexels-photo-771742.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800"
```

**Replace with**:
```tsx
src="/your-uploaded-file.jpg"
```

#### For Project Images (Projects Section):
**Current code** (`src/components/sections/Projects.tsx`):
```tsx
image: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/230544/pexels-photo-230544.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800',
```

**Replace with**:
```tsx
image: '/your-project-image.jpg',
```

### 3. **Verify File Permissions**
```bash
# Check that the file is readable
ls -la public/your-uploaded-file.jpg

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 644 public/your-uploaded-file.jpg
```

### 4. **Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C) and restart
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 5. **Check File Path Format**
- ✅ Correct: `/filename.jpg` (starts with /)
- ❌ Wrong: `filename.jpg` (no leading slash)
- ❌ Wrong: `./filename.jpg` (relative path)

### 6. **Supported File Formats**
Make sure your uploaded file is in a supported format:
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.webp`

### 7. **Browser Cache Issue**
If the image still doesn't show:
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

## Common File Locations for Attachments

| Use Case | Recommended Location | Reference Path |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Profile Image | `public/profile.jpg` | `/profile.jpg` |
| Project Images | `public/projects/project1.jpg` | `/projects/project1.jpg` |
| Icons/Assets | `public/assets/icon.svg` | `/assets/icon.svg` |

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# 1. Create directories if needed
mkdir -p public/projects public/assets

# 2. Move uploaded files to public (replace with your actual filenames)
mv *.jpg *.png *.jpeg public/

# 3. List files to verify
ls -la public/

# 4. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check browser console** for 404 errors
2. **Verify file exists**: Visit `http://localhost:5173/your-file.jpg` directly
3. **Check file size**: Large files (>10MB) might load slowly
4. **Test with different file**: Try with a simple small image first

## Next Steps

1. Identify which specific image you want to replace
2. Follow the appropriate solution above
3. Update the corresponding component code
4. Test in browser
